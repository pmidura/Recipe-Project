<h2 align="center">Recipe Project</h2>

## Description
A group university project to create a website for users who are interested in culinary topics. The site allows users to create an account on the site, add, delete and edit their own recipes, and be inspired by other users' recipes. It has a modern clear interface.

## Scope of work
On my shoulders was the responsibility of creating a login and registration system. I was also responsible for the entire backend of the application in particular jQuery event handling and communication with the MySQL database.
The technologies I used were:
- PHP
- jQuery
- MySQL

I also assisted colleagues in creating the GUI, as well as improving it, and made control of current errors.
